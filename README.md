# Libpng Practice

## Compiling & Running
- The makefile is provided in the repository. You can run ``make`` to use it.
- Make sure you have X11 and libpng on your system, which the Makefile depends on.
- The outputted program will be called `png_view`. An example usage would be ``png_view test.png``
- Press s to take a screenshot. It will save it to a file called test_save.png
